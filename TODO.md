# nice to have
How do we show an explore in a vscode tab?
 - webview won't work, its an iframe and will only show production
 - should we build a lightweight web app and show it in webvew?
backspace on the . in `${TABLE}.` or the } in `${field}` should remove the whole string
- type should be intellisense for filters and parameters
- OAuth to loopback?
- Autocomplete for other fields within the current explore this view is joined
