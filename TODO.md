How do we show an explore in a vscode tab?
 - webview won't work, its an iframe and will only show production
 - should we build a lightweight web app and show it in webvew?
backspace on the . in `${TABLE}.` or the } in `${field}` should remove the whole string
type should be intellisense, different for measures and dimensions
  - filters and parameters we can do later
